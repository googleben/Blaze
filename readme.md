# Blaze

Blaze is a 3D puzzle platformer made in MonoGame for the BPA Software Engineering Team competition. It uses the quirks of orthographic projection to change the way a space behaves based on which angle it is viewed from. A Windows build is available in the Releases page of this repository.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys, enter, and escape to navigate menus. Ingame controls are explained in the first level, being WASD for movement, space for jump, E for interation, and arrow keys to change perspectives.

## Building

This project is designed for .NET 4.5 and MonoGame 3.0 in Visual Studio 2019. If compatible frameworks are installed, the project can be built as any other through Visual Studio.
